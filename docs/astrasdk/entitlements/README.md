# Entitlements

The following `entitlements` classes all inherit the [SDKCommon](../common/README.md#SDKCommon) class.

## getEntitlements

This class does not take any inputs, and returns all entitlements (aka licenses) associated with the Astra Control instance.  This can also be used to programmatically determine whether it is an ACC or ACS environment.
